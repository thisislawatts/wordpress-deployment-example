Aims
---

* Reduce the number of manual steps involved in deployments
* Make it easy for new developer volunteers to understand how to get code reviewed and into production quickly, and to do it!
* Make GitHub the source of truth for what has been deployed to the Staging and Production environments. The mapping would be
  * Default branch `main|master` => Staging
  * Production branch `production` => Production
